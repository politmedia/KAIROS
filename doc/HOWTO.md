# How to do KAIROS
This guide is written in a chronological order, to assist you in the process of using KAIROS in your campaign.

## Preperation

### Gather support
* People who want to work with you
* Other parties with similar interest
* Gather expertise
 * Website administration
 * Social media
 * Politics
 * Branding

### Questions
* Get inspired by debates, news, or questionaires by other parties
* Define main topics
* Formulate closed (yes/no) questions
* Try answering the questions yourself, to verify that the questions are unambiguous

### Branding
* How will the KAIROS page be promoted
* Will the KAIROS page have to be branded, regarding logo's, colors, fonts, etc.
* What information should be present in the page is linked (HTML meta tags), this applies to social media in particular

### Information about politicans and parties
* Establish contact with parties and electoral council
 * What information can they provide, and in what format?
 * Do the parties have employees/members responsible for coordinating these sorts of activities? Because they could best receive a management account.

### Line up initial politicans
* An empty website is no good, so get the commitment of a couple of dozen politicans to fill the questionaire before th launch.
 * If they align with your opinion, they might be more inclined to collaborate, as they will get promotion around the launch.

### Generic information
* What generic pages should be present, and what should be on them

## Setup KAIROS

### Technicalities
* Register a domain
* Get some server to run it on
* Obtain the ability to send out mass-mailings, customized per politician, to send the edit links.

### Securing the deployment

* Disable debug mode
* Get a SSL certificate (payed or free using [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)).
* Setup some kind of monitoring

## Going live

### Pre-announcement
* Coordinate with parties involed
* Select an appropriate time for the launch (e.g. friday evening is a bad time)
* Inform official press and informal promotors
* Maybe have a blank landing page present already
* Inform all politicans a couple of days before the launch of the campaign, and allow them to fill in the questions already. Getting more politicians beforehand will increase the value of the launch.
* Prepare the server capacity for the launch, or ensure the ability to scale up rapidly. Nothing as bad as going down during the launch.

### Switching on
* Create a buzz, to inform as much people as possible.

## Keeping momentum
* Keep promoting the website.
 * Simple announcements of gathered insights, number of visitors, number of politicans, could be a simple reason to put out an announcement.

## After the elections
* Put out an announcement, perhaps summarize all information

## Dismanteling
If the elections are finished, and it is time to clean up the website, this should be done gracefully.

* Export the data for future reference
* Create a (static) summarizing page and have the URL direct to it, to neatly handle future interested visitors.
